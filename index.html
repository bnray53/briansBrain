            <p class="text-left">
                This is a simulator build to demonstrate the cellular automaton known as "Brian's Brain". A cellular automaton
                can be thought of as a simple form of artificial life, in that a new generation of cells is generated or evolved
                from the states of previous cells.
            </p>
        
            <p class="text-left">
                This action is accomplished by checking the state of each previous cell. These states are made up of three forms: "on",
                "dying", and "off". These are indicated by the colors black, grey, and white respectively. As with most cellular
                automaton these previous cell states are then checked against a set of rules to determine the next generations
                cell state. In this particular automaton there are three rules that are followed.
            </p>
        
            <p class="text-left">
                <ol class="text-left">
                    <li>If the previous state of the cell was on (this is indicated by black cells), the cell is switched to
                        dying (this is indicated by grey cells).</li>
                    <li>If the previous state of the cell was dying, the cell is switched to off (this is indicated by a white
                        cell).</li>
                    <li>If the previous state of the cell was off and exactly two of its neighboring cells[1] are on, the cell is
                        switched on.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        
            <p class="text-left">
                With these three rules in place the program starts with a grid of randomly assigned states, and then when the
                start button is clicked new generations are formed based on the rules listed above. The program can be paused or
                reset at any time using the applicable buttons. The simulation will run until all the cells in the grid are off. It
                will then reset the board and run the simulation again with a new randomly generated starting grid.
            </p>
        
            <p class="text-left">
                This particular cellular automaton has a tendency to create unique diagonal shapes, some of which will try to
                replicate all or part of themselves. Some of these replications are identical to each other and are known
                mathematically as "spaceships". The Brian's Brain automaton was named after its creator Brian Silverman who
                created it in the mid 1990's.
            </p>
        
            <p class="text-left">
                This simulator was built using the JavaScript P5.js library and using Bootstrap3 for the page styling. It is
                fully responsive in nature and can be viewed and interacted with on phones, tablets, and computers.
            </p>

                [1]: A cell has eight neighboring cells. The best way to imagine these cells is to picture a 3x3 square block of
                cells with the center cell being the cell in question, the remaining eight cells surrounding this center cell are
                this cells neighboring cells.
